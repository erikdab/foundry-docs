# Lighting

- Darkvision gives Dim Light in darkness but without color
- Dim Light source (like a spell) gives Dim Light in darkness with color
- Bright Light vision gives Dim Light in darkness with color
- Bright Light source (like a spell) vision gives Dim Light in darkness with color

## How to setup

Need to adjust the scene Lighting settings and I also installed the PerfectVision module for grayscale:
1. Darkvision darker than Bright Light - by increasing scene darkness (and using bright lights outside any dark areas) you can dark areas:
    a. look darker for players with Darkvision if they haven't turned on any light sources
    b. entirely invisible for people without Darkvision if they haven't turned on any light sources
2. Darkvision Grayscale - if you want "true" Darkvision with grayscale, install the PerfectVision module. By default Dim Light will be 100% grayscale for players with Darkvision and still have color if a Dim Light source is created (say by a spell)
